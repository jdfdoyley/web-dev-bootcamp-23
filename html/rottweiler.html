Rottweiler
<p>
  The <b>Rottweiler</b> is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large
  or large.
</p>
<p>
  The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil
  butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts
  laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century
  when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many
  parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs,
  guard dogs, and police dogs.
